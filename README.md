# Analysing-Property-Prices-and-Attributes-of-Chifley-Sydney

## Overview
This project is designed for students to understand a wide variety of property data types and sources. It simulates an analyst's role in real-world scenarios, focusing on property market research and analytics through data visualisations and interaction tools.

## Objectives
To ensure a comprehensive understanding of different property data types and their sources.
To provide practical experience in using data visualisation and interaction tools for property market research and analytics.
To educate students on various visualisation techniques for different forms of property data.

## Dataset
The primary dataset for this assignment is sourced from the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) Census data, focusing on a New South Wales State suburb, Chifley. It encompasses seven key categories:

Property Price
House Finance Status
